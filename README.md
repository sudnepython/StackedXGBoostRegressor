# StackedXGBoostRegressor
Predicting Restaurant Revenue using Machine Learning(XGBoost), beating the Kaggle winner score.
In this file I use Kaggle problem on Restaurant Revenue Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/restaurant-revenue-prediction/overview

I have improved the model using stacked XGBoost regressor, however, even without the stacked model the Random Forest Algorithm performs the best. 
My Stacked model beats the current Kaggle winners score by 4%
